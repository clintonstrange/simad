## Description

This application aims to help local car dealerships maintain their automotive inventory.  The group wanted to create an innovative application that renders a spectrum of security for different levels of users.

## User Story

As an employer for a car dealership, I need a web application database that allows me to access my car inventory. 
When I enter the site, I see a nicely structured layout of a page with a dashboard and login form.
Then, when I access the login with a managers credentials, I am able to view in the dashboard to add, edit, and delete cars/car categories.
When I login as a mid level employee, 
Then I am able to view all car models in the dashboard with no ability to add, delete, and edit the inventory's contents.
When I login as regular employee, 
Then I am able to only view current cars in stock.
When I am done with the inventory session and choose to logout,
Then I am taken back to the homepage and securely logged out of the application.
